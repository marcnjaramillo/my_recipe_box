# MyRecipeBox (Work in Progress)

**Rundown** This is a full-stack application built with Ruby on Rails and Hotwire. It's designed to be a social application where users can save their own recipes and interact with others by following, liking others' recipes, and commenting on posted recipes. There are still some features I'm building out, and it is not styled at all right now. I will fill this README out later on, so please be patient with me. If you are interested to see how this project is progressing, please feel free to watch it and stay updated.

## Giving Credit where Credit is Due

I can't claim that I built this all from my own efforts. I hadn't used Hotwire or Stimulus before, so I got a lot of help from [GoRails](https://gorails.com/), specifically the [Nested Comment Threads in Rails](https://gorails.com/series/nested-comment-threads-in-rails) series and the [Hotwire](https://gorails.com/series/hotwire-rails) series (for getting Devise registrations to play nice with Hotwire). This feature is specific to the ability to add comments to recipes.

I also got help from the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) book, specifically the chapter on following users.
